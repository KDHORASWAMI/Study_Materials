API - Application program interface
It act as an interface or communication protocol between clint(fontend) and serer(backend)
API is independent of any langualge
Data will be send by using JSON / XML formate to API 
REST - is arhitectural design to create APIs

Step - Endpoint / BAse URI
HTTP methods: 
GET,POST,DELETE and PUT to commuicate with REST APIs
GET: To exract information from the server
POST : Insert into server
PUT : Update the informaton in server
DELETE : Delete informion in server

Resources:
Resources arepresents API/ Collection which can be accessed from te server
Prameters:
1.Path parameter - 
2.Query Parameter

End point Request URL can be constructed as below:
Base URL/resource/(Query/path)Parameters

POSTMAN - manual testing of API
API contract - Basic details to proceed API testing.

Base URL: https://rahulshettyacademmy.com
Resource : /maps/api/place/add/json
Query Parameter : key=quick123
Http method: POST

To practice 
E:\COURSES\REST_API\Postman_APIContract

some packages are static in REST_Assured
to accept json as a string in jaca
Windows -> peferences -> editer -> typing ......

Eclips will not give auto suggession for static packages
import static io.restassured.RestAssured.*;
import static org.hamcrest.Matchers.*;

JsonPath - class is used to convert string to Json format...(if we want to extract specific field in json file)

Exmple : Complex Json parsing:
1. Print No of courses returned by API
2.Print Purchase Amount
3. Print Title of the first course
4. Print All course titles and their respective Prices
5. Print no of copies sold by RPA Course
6. Verify if Sum of all Course prices matches with Purchase Amount

Advaned Payload creation strategies:

Read Json file :
.body(new String(Files.readAllBytes(Paths.get("Json file path"))))
// readAllBytes  - will read the json file in the form or byte
// String()  - will convert byte data into String format

-multipart - is used to send the file in REST assured
-Limiting Json response through query parameter 
-given().relaxedHTTPSValidation() - is used to bypass the https authentiction

OAuth 2.0 :
Login into Bookmyshow using gmail without signUp into bookmyshow
Requirements:
1. Client	: Bookmyshow
2. Client ID
3. Client secret ID		- which is provided by Google
4. Resource Owner

Access token place a majar role in Oauth
5. Resorce/Athentication server		: Google
Parameters used:
scope : get it from te client or developer
Auh_URL: Authentication url get it from client

Mandatory fields for GetAutjorization code Request:

End Poin: Authorization server URL
Query Parameter: Scope,Auth_URL,client_id,response_typr,redirect_URL
- This operation should perform on browser
Output: Code

Mandatory fields for GetAccessToken request:
End point: Access token URL
Query Params: Code, Cliend_id, client secret, redirect_URL, grant_type
Output: Access token
